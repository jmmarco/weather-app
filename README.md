# A simple weather app that uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/current)

## Quickstart
- Clone the repository and open `index.html` in a Browser window

### Details

- Main code is built using vanilla JavaScript and the new [`fetch` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) and the [geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation)
- Basic styling using [Bootstrap's Jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#jumbotron)
- Thanks to Erik Flowers and his [Weather Icons library](https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons)
